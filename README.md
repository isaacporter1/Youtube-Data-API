This was a Machine Learning Project for one of my courses at Weber State. I created a ML Model to predict views based on subscriber count, keyword factors, date of posting, things like that.

This was not for my videos, as I did not have enough data. So I used a few YouTuber's public data to run an analysis on their Video's numbers!
